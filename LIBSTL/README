This software is a small STL replacement for DJGPP c++ compiler so you 
do not need to link in the full STL all the time. 
You can use it to make things for dosbox, a dos emulator, 
dosbox can be found at 
http://www.dosbox.com/ and the DJGPP toolkit is available at 
http://www.delorie.com/
You need to setup 
gpp (which is linux's g++) and run make to compile this. 
Note that you must unzip djgpp's zipfiles with unzip32.exe
which can also be found on ftp.delorie.com

You need the following zipfiles :
djdev
gcc473
gpp473
bnu223
gpp273
txi
csdpmi
mak
unzip32.exe

Do not forget the unix2dos command which can be found at 
http://www.programmersheaven.com/ to make your files dos compatible.
